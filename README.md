## 🌐 Website Overview

This website provides a structured and interactive interface to learn about the InMoov robot. It includes technical knowledge, tools, build instructions, and component specifications.

### 🔍 About InMoov

> Machine vision is one of the most important tasks for interaction between the robot and its environment. It provides vital information about the elements around it.  
>  
> InMoov is the **first life-size humanoid robot** that can be produced using **3D printing**, with an **open-source design** accessible to the public.  
>  
> The robot features advanced head and vision control systems that allow it to track object movement through vector following. Vision range limitations were carefully considered to design optimized tracking and motion algorithms for head movement under controlled conditions.
